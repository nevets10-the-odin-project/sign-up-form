## Introduction

This project is intended to give you a chance to flex some of the new items you’ve been absorbing over the past few lessons. This time it’s a sign-up form for an imaginary service.

## Post project reflection:

Sticking to the prompt this time around. ~~This project should hopefully be more mobile friendly than earlier projects.~~ This is absolutely not mobile friendly. I'll just wait until I get to the responsive design portion of the course before bothering with it.
